# TikTok Favorites Downloader

A Python script to help download your favorite TikTok videos. The script adds download buttons to your favorites page and automatically handles the download process.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules for better maintainability:

### Core Files
- `main.py` - Entry point of the application. Initializes components and starts the download process.
- `browser_manager.py` - Handles Chrome browser setup and profile management using undetected-chromedriver.
- `tiktok_scraper.py` - Core TikTok interaction logic, including video detection and download handling.
- `airtable_manager.py` - Manages Airtable integration for tracking downloaded videos.

Each module has a specific responsibility:
- Browser Manager: Configures and manages Chrome instances with user profiles
- TikTok Scraper: Handles all TikTok-specific operations (navigation, video detection, download buttons)
- Airtable Manager: Creates and updates records for downloaded videos

## ðŸ‘‹ For Non-Technical Users

This tool is designed to be user-friendly, even if you're not familiar with programming! We recommend:

1. **Using Windsurf Editor**: 
   - Download and install Windsurf, a smart code editor that can help you set up and run this tool
   - Windsurf will read this README and guide you through the setup process
   - It can help you make necessary changes like setting your TikTok username

2. **Before Running**:
   - You'll need to change the TikTok username in the code from `@dysonsmear` to your username
   - If you're concerned about security, feel free to:
